It's been designed to deal with high volumes of messages, as well as occasional publications.\r\n\r\nmqtt-spy is a JavaFX application, so in theory should work on any operating system with an appropriate version of Java 8 installed. Tried on Linux Mint 16/17 and Windows 7/8 (note: because of the ControlsFX dependency, versions prior to 0.1.0 are not fully compatible with JRE/JDK 8u20 & above).\r\n\r\nmqtt-spy-daemon is a Java-based command line tool that does not require a GUI environment. Basic functionality works with Java 7, whereas some of the advanced features like scripting require Java 8 to be installed.\r\n\r\nFor more information see the project's wiki at https://github.com/kamilfb/mqtt-spy/wiki.\r\n","google":"UA-51822107-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
