mqtt-spy is an open source utility intended to help you with monitoring activity on MQTT topics. It's been designed to deal with high volumes of messages, as well as occasional publications.

mqtt-spy is a JavaFX application, so in theory should work on any operating system with an appropriate version of Java 8 installed. Tried on Linux Mint 16/17 and Windows 7/8 (note: because of the ControlsFX dependency, versions prior to 0.1.0 are not fully compatible with JRE/JDK 8u20 & above).

mqtt-spy-daemon is a Java-based command line tool that does not require a GUI environment. Basic functionality works with Java 7, whereas some of the advanced features like scripting require Java 8 to be installed.
