Welcome to the mqtt-spy source code repository.

For more information on the available functionality, see the project's wiki at https://github.com/kamilfb/mqtt-spy/wiki.

The branching model (not fully in place yet) is as follows*:

  * master branch - where all the official releases live; tag for each release
  * development branch - where all the work is actually taking place
  * feature and release branches - used when required; for experimenting with new features and for major releases respectively

\* - this has been heavily influenced by http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/.

The eclipse_paho tags is what was submitted to the Eclipse Paho project in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=458899.
